# BryanSummerResearch2018
A repository for code and other files used by the Simpson College Bryan summer research students.

The code in this repository is being developed by Levi Lefebure, Mason Remington, and Graham Brooks during an 8-week summer research project.  These first and second-year Simpson College students are working under the guidance of Dr. Heidi Berger and are using data to develop models about the use of clinics in the U.S. specializing in treating Down Syndrome patients.

The data they are using comes from a variety of sources.  The public data will be accessed through the R code.  The confidential or proprietary data will not be posted here.
