# BryanSummerResearch2018

A repository for code and other files used by the Simpson College Bryan summer research students.

## The team

The code in this repository is being developed by Levi Lefebure, Mason Remington, and Graham Brooks during an 8-week summer research project.  These first and second-year Simpson College students are working under the guidance of Dr. Heidi Berger and are using data to develop models about the use of clinics in the U.S. specializing in treating Down Syndrome patients.  They are also collaborating with a medical anthropologist, Anne Koehler, of the University of Connecticut.

## The data

The data they are using comes from a variety of sources.  

- The public data will be accessed through the R code or will be posted in this repository.  

- The confidential or proprietary data will not be posted here.  For that reason, even though the code is public, only the team will be able to execute the code.

## To the team

You each have your own file.  You can pull those, edit, and then send a pull request any time you want.

If you want to edit other files, check with the team to see if anyone else is working on them at the same time.
